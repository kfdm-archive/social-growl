# Growl notifications for Socialcast
Simple script to poll and growl Socialcast updates

	# Run as a background daemon
	$ ./social-growl

	# See help for extra arguments
	$ ./social-growl --help


I'm not actively using Socialcast at the moment so this project may not receieve a lot of attention. But if there are any bugs/requests I will try to get to them as I have time.
